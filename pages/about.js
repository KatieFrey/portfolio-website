          Iâ€™m naturally a San Franciscan who found her way into the New York
          area. As of today, I live in Jersey City with my husband and we dream
          about owning a corgi one day.

          <br />
          Before altering my course into coding, I acquired a B.A. in Musical
          Theatre at California State University, Chico. As an{" "}
          <em>aspiring actress</em>, I eventually ended up in the service
          industry as a Restaurant Manager.

          What I love about coding, and why I decided to change directions, is
          because there is always a problem to solve! I'm naturally inquisitive
          and stubbornly persistent in figuring out how things work.
          <br />

          I'm very passionate and dedicated to my work and always open to
          learning new technologies and frameworks. I have a defined sense of
          aesthetic and enjoy making thoughtful, engaging, and functional web
          applications.
